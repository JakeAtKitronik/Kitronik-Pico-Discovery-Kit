The Discovery Kit uses MicroPython as its teaching language. 
This is a Python version created specially for small embedded microcontrollers, such as the Pico and the popular BBC micro:bit. 
Go to https://docs.micropython.org/ for a complete set of documents about MicroPython.

Code examples are created in Thonny, which is a dedicated Python Editor.
Thonny is also used to send the working code to the Pico. 
Go to https://thonny.org/ to download it and follow there install instructions.
